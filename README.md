# Pedometer

Julia implementation of the [Oxford Step Counter](https://github.com/Oxford-step-counter/Java-Step-Counter/tree/dfd079a2678c8d29adbba08de840367f4d4fcd41).

**NOTE** If you are looking to a Julia repo so spot best practice and stuff, this is not what you're looking for :D
I'm tweaking and study the language while working on the project. So I advise against using it as an example.

## Motivation

I wanted to make a step counter to use with the Pinephone.
